Which, given that the community is larger than just me, seems
appropriate?

There are, indeed, and they are already mentioned there (under the
section "Alternate implementations").

Up-to-date client implementations exist for Windows, FreeBSD, qemu, and
bare metal, as well as in library form through libnbd.

There also used to be implementations for The Hurd and Plan 9, but they
appear to have disappeared off the Internet.

Finally, there is also an implementation of nbd in "bitrig", an openbsd
fork for arm machines. I can't find any reference to it anymore though.
