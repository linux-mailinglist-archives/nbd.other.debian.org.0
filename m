Actually ignore my comment here. I was misreading the text above
as saying that the hostname part should be interpreted as a username,
which is obviously wrong.

Yeah, ignore my comment.

I thought it did, but after testing, I can confirm they are different.

$ netstat -a -n -x -p | grep './unix-demo'
unix  2      [ ]         STREAM                   638293   15094/./unix-demo           @a
unix  2      [ ]         STREAM                   638292   15094/./unix-demo           @a@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

IOW, if users want padding, they must specify the URI encoded
trailing NULs.

I would note that QEMU is not able to support abstract sockets
right now & it isn't easy to add this if the path contains
real NULs. In QAPI it uses 'str' which assumes NUL-terminated
string with no embedded NULs. The sockets code liberally
uses strlen() too.  A common "hack" is to use "@" in place of
a real NUL, though that makes life confusing if you want a
real "@".

We could allow either.
