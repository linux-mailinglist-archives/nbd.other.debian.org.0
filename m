I guess the idea is to have a zero-install solution for the browser.
As I said in the email earlier this is very common for IPMI-type
remote access to blade servers and in my experience is implemented
using a Java applet and a proprietary protocol terminated at the BMC
(which then emulates a virtual CDROM to the server).  There are some
HP blade servers on Red Hat's internal Beaker instance where you can
play with this.  For qemu we wouldn't need to invent a new protocol
when NBD is available and already implemented (albeit not yet on top
of WebSockets).

The NBD server must run inside the browser and therefore be either
written from scratch in Javascript, or an existing server
cross-compiled to WASM (if that is possible - I don't really know).
