All kinds of ublk disk supports such seamlessly recovery which is
provided by UBLK_CMD_START_USER_RECOVERY/UBLK_CMD_END_USER_RECOVERY.
During user recovery, the bdev and gendisk instance won't be gone,
and will become fully functional after the recovery(such as reconnect)
is successful.

So yes for this seamlessly reconnect error handling.
