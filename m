As a followup, I got this reply from Hanno BÃ¶ck on oss-security:

https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/08/11/8
| The buffering vulnerabilities we found are in STARTTLS implementations
| that have the expectation to enforce a secure connection, but suffer
| from various vulnerabilities in the implementation.

One of the reasons that SMTP and IMAP were particularly problematic in
implementations is that they are line-based protocols, with
arbitrary-sized packets where the length isn't known until the \n is
reached.  Both clients and servers have to choose whether to read one
character at a time (painfully slow) or read ahead into a buffer and
then processing what is in the buffer.  Many of the CVEs raised were
in regards to mishandling such buffers, such as acting on
previously-buffered plaintext even after the switch to encryption.

Thankfully, the NBD protocol has a much more structured handshake
(while different NBD_OPT commands can have different payload lenghts,
at least the header of each packet designates the length in advance,
reducing the need for read-ahead buffering), as well as documentation
that the NBD_OPT_ phase is a lockstep algorithm (neither client nor
server should be building up a buffer of more than one
command/response).

Another aspect of the SMTP/IMAP security holes came from incorrectly
carrying state across the transition to encryption (making a false
assumption that the answer made in plaintext will be the same when
encrypted).  Unfortunately, I have realized that the NBD spec has one
bit of state (NBD_OPT_SET_META_CONTEXT) where it is currently silent
on how to handle that state across a transition to encrypted.  So I
plan on posting a followup patch that matches the actual
implementation of nbdkit in opportunistic mode (qemu-nbd does not
offer opportunistic mode, and nbd-server does not suport
NBD_OPT_SET_META_CONTEXT): a server in opportunistic mode MUST treat
the NBD_OPT_STARTTLS command as wiping out any earlier
NBD_OPT_SET_META_CONTEXT.
