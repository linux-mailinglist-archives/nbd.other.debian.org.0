It starts here (link to patch#7):

http://mid.mail-archive.com/20230525130108.757242-8-eblake@redhat.com

(The primary libguestfs archive works too, but mailman splits the
archives on month boundaries, and so the patch is still in the May
bucket, but my reply is in the June one:

https://listman.redhat.com/archives/libguestfs/2023-May/031613.html
https://listman.redhat.com/archives/libguestfs/2023-June/031736.html
)

The particular topic is at the very end of my message.

Understood! Thanks!

So for example, in extent64_wrapper_locked(), if we exited the called
nbd_internal_ocaml_alloc_extent64_array() function with caml_failwith(),
the caml_copy_string() and caml_copy_int64() allocations, stored earlier
into "CAMLlocal"s "metacontextv" and "offsetv", would not be leaked?

Ah, understood.

Right, <https://v2.ocaml.org/manual/intfc.html> too contains a related
warning:

  Rule 5â€ƒ After a structured block (a block with tag less than
  No_scan_tag) is allocated with the low-level functions, all fields of
  this block must be filled with well-formed values before the next
  allocation operation. [...]

Thankfully it also says, "You can ignore those rules if you stick to the
simplified allocation function caml_alloc".

I'm slightly interested in learning the OCaml runtime details, but at
the same time I feel like not knowing them (and relying only on the
docs) might allow me to write more "portable" code...
